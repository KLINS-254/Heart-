      🌹<br>
      When I see you, time slows down,<br>
      Your presence lifts me off the ground.<br>
      No words can tell, no stars above,<br>
      The depth of what I feel is love.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re the song my heart keeps near,<br>
      The gentle voice I long to hear.<br>
      Each beat of mine, both night and day,<br>
      Whispers your name in every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      So take my hand, and you will see,<br>
      The world feels right with you and me.<br>
      No greater truth my heart could show,<br>
      Than loving you—forever so.
    
    </p>
    <p>
      ⚡ And from my heart, hear this truth:<br>
      I love you with everything in me, and I want you to be my one and only girl. You are my choice, my dream, and my forever. ❤
      
   Inshallah having you as a friend. 💋😍👫
