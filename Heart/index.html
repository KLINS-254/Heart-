      🌹<br>
      I met her,<br>
      and her smile shattered the silence of my soul.<br>
      It was not just a curve of lips<br>
      it was the sun breaking chains of night,<br>
      the gentle fire that made me believe<br>
      in beauty that saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes…<br>
      O those eyes<br>
      like quiet oceans that pull me into their depth.<br>
      When I look, I drown willingly,<br>
      and even in drowning, I live.<br>
      Her face is a scripture of softness,<br>
      each line carved by angels,<br>
      each glance a prayer answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      No day dares pass<br>
      without her walking through my thoughts.<br>
      I carry her in the marrow of my bones,<br>
      in the hush of my breath,<br>
      in the rhythm of every silent cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I walk through storms alone.<br>
      I crave her hug<br>
      crave it until my chest trembles.<br>
      Tears rise, not as weakness,<br>
      but as rivers of longing that cannot be dammed.<br>
      I whisper into the night,<br>
      “Come, hold me,<br>
      let your arms be the refuge<br>
      where my pain learns to sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I love her<br>
      with the violence of fire,<br>
      with the tenderness of rain.<br>
      Her beauty is not skin alone;<br>
      it is eternity dressed in flesh.<br>
      Eyes that command the sky,<br>
      a face that softens even grief,<br>
      a presence that could heal<br>
      a thousand broken yesterdays.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I cry,<br>
      so I crave,<br>
      so I wait<br>
      for her hug to descend like mercy,<br>
      to seal the day before it dies,<br>
      to remind me that love is not a promise deferred<br>
      but an embrace fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until then,<br>
      I am the storm aching for her calm,<br>
      the fire begging for her rain,<br>
      the man who loves her<br>
      beyond the reach of words.
    </p>
